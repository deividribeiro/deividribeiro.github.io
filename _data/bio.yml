bio: "I have experience tackling complex technical challenges across large-scale software and hardware systems, with a focus on transforming unstructured data into insights. My experience spans leading cross-functional teams to develop and deploy machine learning models leveraging efficient pipelines for automated results.


Drawing from a foundation in statistical modeling, time-series analysis, and probabilistic and causal methods, I've built scalable ML infrastructure capable of supporting high-throughput scientific analysis. What sets me apart is my ability to bridge complexity with clear communication. I excel at translating complicated concepts and their implications for audiences across different disciplines and backgrounds.


As a leader and mentor, I'm known for fostering progress within cross-disciplinary teams while maintaining project management oversight. My academic foundation includes education, research, and teaching experience from both Columbia University and Brown University, which informs my approach to teaching and learning."
