 - title: "Groundhog Camera"
   description: "In an exciting personal project, I set out to film the groundhogs on my property to observe their behavior. I built a Raspberry Pi camera and configured a home NAS to create a seamless monitoring system. By tuning the video capture to save only when motion is detected, I collected data, which I organized into training and signal files for a video detection machine learning. This endeavor not only deepened my understanding of the local wildlife but also honed my technical skills in data collection and analysis."

 - title: "Articles Read"
   description: "In my recent project, I delved into my reading habits using the Pocket app to analyze how frequently I engage with articles. By examining reading times, I uncovered key trends regarding my reading frequency and overall patterns that emerged over the years. Notably, graduate school significantly influenced my reading habits over the past 11 years, shaping both the quantity and quality of my article consumption. This exploration has provided valuable insights into my evolving relationship with reading."

// - title: "VTS Scheduler"
//   description: "I worked on a project aimed at developing an observation scheduler for VERITAS. This initiative addresses the intricacies of managing 30-minute observation runs, during which significant changes in the night sky can occur, while also balancing multiple competing science priorities. The scheduling challenge is intensified by the presence of pre-scheduled runs and the need to accommodate unforeseen astronomical events, such as supernovae. Our goal is to create a reliable scheduling framework that facilitates efficient parsing, editing, and recomputation, ultimately optimizing the utilization of observational time and resources."
