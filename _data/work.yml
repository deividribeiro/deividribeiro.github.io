    details:
      - Continued leadership within the VERITAS collaboration by chairing the Analysis Coordination Group, leading development of primary analysis package in C++, and extensive student mentorship.
      - Developed ML models for multi-modal image classification of gamma-ray images. Wrote custom LSTM, wGAN, conditional GAN and vision transformers neural networks.

  - title: PHD STUDENT  
    period: August 2016 - September 2022
    details:
      - PhD astrophysicist with 8 years experience in data science, machine learning, research, software and hardware development.
      - As part of the VERITAS collaboration, I observed and analyzed high-energy gamma-rays, which I fit to astrophysical models of Superluminous Supernovae, GRBs, gravitational waves and blazar galaxies. I also supported the collaboration through extensive mentoring and service projects, including lead software development of the primary analysis package written in C++.
      - Built, installed and commissioned the mirror panels toward the alignment of the prototype Schwarszchild Couder telescope to <3 arcmin angular resolution.
      - Preceptor and Lead Teaching Fellow in the physics department where I was award the Alan Sachs Teaching award.
